# Pokémon Trading Card Game Inventory
This project is dedicated to displaying my personal collection of Pokémon cards in a more visual 
manner than a spreadsheet.

# Description
A production version of the project's webpage can be found at 
[https://ptcg-inventory.herokuapp.com/](https://ptcg-inventory.herokuapp.com/)

My personal collection of cards is visually displayed on the homepage via the Pokémon card sets 
(eg. X & Y, Sun & Moon, etc.). 

## Features
### Homepage
An overview of my personal collection is displayed on this page, organized by the Pokémon card sets. 
Each set has three bubbles that give a quick glance into the number of cards owned in that set. The 
bubbles, from left to right on each set, represent the total number of normal, reverse foil, and holo 
foil cards.

### Subpages
There is a subpage for each set that includes a table of owned cards. As of publishing this README, the 
tables do not include cards that are unowned. In the future, these subpages should visually display the 
collection using the cards' images instead of the tables.
